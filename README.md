# OPEN-RPC Playground
A place to play around with OPEN-RPC.

## For Non-developers
This is a tool for editing, validating and previewing OPEN-RPC documents.

## What is it?
This is meant to be an all-in-one developer portal for OPEN-RPC documents. It includes an editor and a live-preview of the documentation.

This helps developers visualize the OPEN-RPC and iterate very quickly on creating OPEN-RPC documents via the built in editor tooling.

## Usage

Navigate to [playground.open-rpc.org](https://playground.open-rpc.org/) and start playing around. You can build your own OPEN-RPC document, validate existing documents quickly, or use the [examples](https://github.com/open-rpc/examples).

## Keybinds

- `CTRL + SPACE` - auto complete (TAB or ENTER to complete)
- `CTRL + N/CTRL + P` - down/up a line (also works as up/down in autocomplete)
- `ALT + SHIFT + F` - format document
- `CMD + K + I` - pop up tooltip under cursor (this one is tricky, you have to hold `CMD`)
- `CMD + ALV + V` - toggle vim mode
